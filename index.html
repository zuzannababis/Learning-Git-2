            <h3>Do not go gentle into that good night</h3>
            <h5>by Dylan Thomas</h5>
            <p>Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
                Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
                Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
            <p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
                Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
                Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
            <p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
                Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
                Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
            <p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
                And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
                Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
            <p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
                Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
                Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
